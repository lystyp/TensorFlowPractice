原本的code 有個error
參考https://gist.github.com/omimo/5d393ed5b64d2ca0c591e4da04af6009的下面

The script "prep_model_tf1.py" has an issue when running it. It give the following error message:
'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 98: invalid start byte
What cause this error is the fact than the file needs to be read in Binary.

So just change from "r" (read):
with tf.gfile.Open(output_frozen_graph_name, "r") as f:
data = f.read()
input_graph_def.

To "rb" (read binary):
with tf.gfile.Open(output_frozen_graph_name, "rb") as f:
data = f.read()
input_graph_def.
